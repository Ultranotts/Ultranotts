- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! If you have looked at my profile you might be looking to learn more about me. I am currently a college student looking to expand my imagination into the world of coding.
I am currently learning how to code in mainly JavaScript and Python, and would like to dedicate my learnings into the creation of bots. Some may be made for you, the people to freely
copy and change it up to your liking, while some will be made so you guys can preview how it works, if any developers wish to contact me to collaborate on making bots and/or anything
Discord Bot related, feel free to contact me using either my discord: Radonston#7380. Or my twitter: @RealUltranotts.
